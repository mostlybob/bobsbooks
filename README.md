# Bob's Books
After playing with a few cataloguing services, I thought it would be fun to put together a little app to catalog books using node and mongodb. Why those two? I could easily do the same thing in ASP.Net MVC and SQL Server, but that's my day job. Node and Mongo look like less muss & fuss, plus I can do it on lighter resources and move away from the mighty hegemony. Kidding. I just want to take a stab at something different.

It's early days, but I have a few learning goals with this:
* The two big ones are node and mongodb
* I want to use Python to interact with the admittedly primitive API
* Some hopeful spin-off effects are getting more comfortable with markdown and git / github
  * others to come, I'm sure
* A secondary purpose is to practice documenting the project with the hope of presenting some aspect of it at UG meetings or the like
  * the [blog](http://mostlybob.github.io/) will probably come in handy for this
 
I know it's light on technical details, but in the spirit of ready-fire-aim, let's get on with it.
